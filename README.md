# WeiHua-Data-Communication

Project initialized from the paper: "Time-varying link resource allocation algorithm".

This repository will contain an implementation, experiments, and notebooks reproducing the key results.

Contents
- `src/`: implementation of algorithms
- `notebooks/`: analysis and experiments
- `data/`: sample datasets and synthetic generators
- `tests/`: unit tests

Quick start (python):

1. Create a virtual environment
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run `python -m src.demo` to run a small demo

See `docs/` for design notes (to be added).
